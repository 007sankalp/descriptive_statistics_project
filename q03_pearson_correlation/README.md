## Calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) for the SalePrice column for the two loaded datasets?

Great job there ... 
Let's keep this pace ongoing and move on to our next task.
In our lectures we have already learnt that Correlation is a technique we use to investigate the relation between quantitative and continuous variables. 

You will be using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) which is a measure of the strength of the association between two variables. 

**Note :**
The nearer the scatter of points is to a straight line, the higher the strength of association between the variables.
For these you don't need to load the data, we have already done it for you.

## Write a function `correlation()` that

Calculates the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) for the SalePrice column for the two loaded datasets.


### Parameters:

None 

The required data has already been loaded for you.


### Returns:

| Return | dtype | description |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Pearson Correlation Coeffecient | Float | Pearson correlation coeffecient|
