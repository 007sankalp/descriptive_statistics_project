# Visualize mean, median and mode 

Now, that we have found the mean, median and mode, let's plot and see where these points lie on the histogram of sale price data. Also, can you draw any insights looking at the position of these central tendencies?

For these you don't need to load the data, we have already done it for you.

Plotting the values returned from the previous task will help us visualize the data better.

You need to plot the following things for the SalePrice column
* Mean
* Median
* Mode

**Note :** 
* You can use function defined in the previous assignment(s) if needed
* You can use the `axvline()` or any other equivalent function in `matplotlib` to draw the lines
